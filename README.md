# Find-The-Difference
Solution for "Leetcode 389. Find the Difference"

# Description

Given two strings, "s" and "t", where "t" is generated by randomly shuffling "s" and adding an additional letter at a random position, the "findTheDifference" function determines and returns the added letter in "t".

The solution uses the XOR operator to find the difference between the two strings, exploiting the reversible property of XOR. The code iterates through each character in the strings "s" and "t", applying XOR between the ASCII value of the character and an accumulator ("c"). The final result, converted back to a character, represents the added letter in "t".
